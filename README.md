 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately predict one of 10 classes for each image in the dataset. The model is trained on labeled data and evaluated for accuracy using test data.



1.Dataset: CIFAR-10

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision. It consists of:

- 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
- 10 classes:  
  `airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck`
- Split:  
  - 50,000 images for training  
  - 10,000 images for testing

Images are evenly distributed across the 10 classes.


 2.Technologies Used

This project is built with the following tools and libraries:

- Python â€“ Programming Language  
- TensorFlow/Keras â€“ Deep Learning Framework  
- NumPy â€“ Numerical Operations  
- Matplotlib â€“ Data Visualization

3.Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this project is a sequential model consisting of the following layers:

1. Conv2D Layer â€“ 32 filters of size (3x3), activation: ReLU  
2. MaxPooling2D â€“ pool size (2x2)  
3. Dropout â€“ 0.2 (to prevent overfitting)  
4. Conv2D Layer â€“ 64 filters of size (3x3), activation: ReLU  
5. MaxPooling2D â€“ pool size (2x2)  
6. Dropout â€“ 0.3  
7. Conv2D Layer â€“ 64 filters, (3x3), activation: ReLU  
8. Flatten Layer â€“ Converts 2D feature maps to 1D  
9. Dense Layer â€“ 64 units, activation: ReLU  
10. Dropout â€“ 0.4  
11. Output Layer â€“ Dense(10) with Softmax activation (for multiclass classification)

4.Training Settings
- Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Metrics: Accuracy  
- Epochs: Customizable (usually between 20-50)  
- Batch Size: 64 (can vary)



5.Results

- Final Test Accuracy: ~70%  
- Visualizations:  
  - Training vs Validation Accuracy  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Sample Predictions with Actual Labels

These results show the model can generalize reasonably well to unseen data in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
